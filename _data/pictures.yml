      Merchants travelling the Silk Road introduced Kombucha to India, Japan and Russia.
      Because of the many health benefits associated with drinking kombucha, the tea quickly
      became customary in many households across Asia. As a result of its rapid spread,
      kombucha became known by several different names including Tea Kvass, Mushroom Tea,
      Miracle Tea, and Elixer of Long Life.
    year: ~200 B.C.

      A Korean physician is said to have cured the ailing Japanese Emperor Ingyo, using
      a fermented tea beverage. The result was a widespread consumption of kombucha throughout
      Japan. The Samurai class were particularly fond of kombucha. They considered it a form of
      Chi, a revitalizing life force, and would carry flasks of it into battle.
    year: ~415 A.D.

      Mongol warriors in the armies of Genghis Khan drank fermented beverages to fuel them on
      military campaigns. At the height of it's power, the Mongol Empire stretched all the way
      from Hungary to China, so Mongol riders could sometimes be away from home and on the go
      for years on end.
    year: ~1220 A.D.

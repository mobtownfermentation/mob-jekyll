    title: Kombucha
    body: >
      is a fermented drink that has been brewed and consumed for over two millennia. The
      revitalizing effects of the beverage were recognized and used by many cultures around
      the world. Modern day studies on the health benefits of consuming fermented foods have
      only proven our ancestors right. Kombucha is loaded with vitamins and acids that help
      strengthen the immune system. It has probiotics and enzymes that are known to bolster
      digestion and replenish the good bacteria in your gut. Kombucha also boosts liver
      function, because it contains the same acids that the liver releases to eliminate
      toxins from the body.

        Adam and Sergio first learned about kombucha in 2000 when their parents
        started brewing it at home. Sharing their curiosity and passion for fermentation,
        brewing kombucha became a family affair at their home in Baltimore. A few years later
        in 2009, when Sergio and Adamâ€™s parents moved to Peru, they left the fermentation
        canisters and brewing tools with Adam. One day, while cleaning out the garage, he
        came across the kombucha equipment. He began reminiscing about how he used to brew
        kombucha with his family, and decided to give it a go. He was hooked. Seeing the
        brewing process as a puzzle, Adam began working diligently to master the art. Initially
        using friends and family as guinea pigs, he first perfected the process his parents taught
        him, and then began exploring the use of different flavors. He realized that the use of
        certain flavors allowed him to add a new dimension to the drink, while still highlighting
        the crisp and bubbly tones that make kombucha unique. It did not take long for his friends
        to taste the appeal. Over the next two years he supplied his drink to family, friends, and
        a group of Johns Hopkins students that had become regulars.  As orders grew larger, and Adam
        grew busier with his job and band, he looked to Sergio to help out since he already knew the
        process. Eventually, brewing began taking up their weekends, friends of friends were ordering
        consistently, and word of their kombucha had spread throughout Hampden. Knowing that the
        company would need more help, Adam and Sergio pitched the idea to their childhood friend
        Sid in May 2014. Mobtown Fermentation and Wild Kombucha were born.

      Mongol warriors in the armies of Genghis Khan drank fermented beverages to fuel them on
      military campaigns. At the height of it's power, the Mongol Empire stretched all the way
      from Hungary to China, so Mongol riders could sometimes be away from home and on the go
      for years on end.
    year: ~1220 A.D.
